Copy array of selected vertices into a list. Initialize a List<int> variable to store matched indices.

Iterate through all items of the list.
For each vertex i:
	If it's not in the capture group:
		Initialize a list that contains a capture group. Add i.
		For each vertex j:
			If the magnitude of the ij vector is less or equal to threshold, add j to the list.
		Take the average of the positions in the capture group.
		For each item in the capture group:
			move it to the average position
			add it to the matched list
